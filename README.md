- You can put the app in Mini Mode which hides the sidebar and is optimized for small window sizes

### Keyboard Shortcuts ‚å®Ô∏è

- Cmd-2 focuses the profile view
- Cmd-3 focuses the friends view
- Cmd-J selects the current scrobble in the details view
- Cmd-[ and Cmd-] select the previous and next scrobble

### Known Issues üö®

- At this moment, there is no caching of unsubmitted scrobbles if you lose connection or if Last.fm is down
- The app will cease to function if your internet connection is lost. Make sure to restart the app if this occurs
- There is currently no functionality to relaunch the app after shutdown, log out, or restart‚Äîyou must launch the app manually.
- During setup, the LastRedux window may disappear behind the web browser. Minimize the web browser window or find LastRedux in Mission Control to bring the window back
- If the web browser doesn't open during setup, the URL text can only be copied with Cmd+C. At this moment, a bug prevents the context menu from appearing

- On macOS Big Sur, the app icon in the status bar is too small

### Known Apple Music Issues üçé
